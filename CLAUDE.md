# Bay Club Connect Pickleball Court Reservation Helper


## What This Is

A Tampermonkey userscript (`loading_script.user.js`) that improves the court booking experience on bayclubconnect.com. The app natively only shows availability for a single "home" club, but Bay Club members can book at any club. This script fetches availability across all four Bay Area clubs in parallel and displays them in a unified UI.

## Who I am as a developer of this application

I have been a professional programmer since 1998. Read the LinkedInProfile.pdf in this same folder to learn about my programming background to get a sense of my technical level and knowledge. But also recognize that I used many of the languages and tools year ago and so am not fluent in them anymore. What I'm most fluent in is Android development and Kotlin. It's probably best to treat me as a senior, experienced developer with a lot of skills, but also one who has not programmed in Javascript or written HTML in a long time, and so is better at reading these things than writing them. Also Javascript has changed a lot since I last had mastered it.

## Working style

This is a JavaScript project. Use JavaScript for all new files and modifications unless otherwise specified.

Write comments as complete sentences that end in punctuation. Avoid abbreviations when reasonable so comments are easy to scan later.

Prefer closures and other encapsulation techniques over free-floating global variables, and keep mutable state in the narrowest possible scope.

In general, prefer Douglas Crockford "Javascript: The Good Parts" style of Javascript coding and modularization.

After completing a set of changes, offer to commit and push with a descriptive commit message summarizing what changed.

When resuming work from a previous session, start by reading recent git log and checking git status to understand current state.

When the script is already reliable for the current friend-group scope and only minor styling or speculative edge-case ideas remain, prefer no-change unless there is a reproducible user-facing bug.

## The Four Clubs

```javascript
const CLUBS = {
    broadway:      '9a2ab1e6-bc97-4250-ac42-8cc8d97f9c63',
    redwoodShores: '95eb0299-b5cf-4a9f-8b35-e4b3bd505f18',
    southSF:       'ce7e7607-09e6-4d16-8197-1fffb70db776',
    santaClara:    '3bc78448-ec6b-49e1-a2ae-64abd68e646b',
};
```

Broadway and South SF have indoor courts only. Santa Clara has a 60-minute max booking (no 90-minute slots).

## Key Architectural Patterns

### XHR Interception
The script patches `XMLHttpRequest.prototype.open`, `send`, and `setRequestHeader` to:
1. Intercept the native availability request and trigger our own parallel fetches for all clubs
2. Capture `Authorization` and `X-SessionId` headers for reuse in our own requests
3. Intercept the `courtbookings` POST and replace it with our own booking body (correct club, court, time)

The monkey-patch wiring is installed through an in-file `installXhrInterceptors()` function so interceptor internals (including booking dedupe state) stay closure-scoped.
Per-request XHR metadata (method, URL, Request-Id) is tracked in a closure-scoped `WeakMap` rather than custom properties on XHR instances.

## XHR Response Interception (Fake Slot Injection)

Angular reads the availability response via the `response` property (not `responseText`) on the XHR object. 
We intercept this in `XMLHttpRequest.prototype.open` by attaching a `load` event listener to any request 
matching `connect-api.bayclubs.io/court-booking/api/1.0/availability`. If the response contains zero 
available time slots but does have courts, we inject a single fake 7:00–7:30 AM slot using a real courtId 
from the response, then override both `response` and `responseText` via `Object.defineProperty` so Angular 
renders it as a clickable native slot.

This solves the fundamental problem that our multi-club UI needs a native Angular slot to secretly click 
in order to advance the Angular state machine when the user hits Next. Without this, if the home club has 
no availability for the selected date, there would be nothing to click and the booking flow would be dead. 
The fake slot is never actually booked — our `send` interceptor replaces the outgoing booking request with 
the user's real selection before it reaches the server.

Note: `configurable: true` is required on the `Object.defineProperty` calls to avoid errors if the 
property is defined more than once.

### Angular State Machine Hack
The app is Angular-based. We can't easily drive its state machine directly, so when a user selects one of our injected slots, we secretly click a native Angular time slot to advance Angular's state. We then intercept the outgoing booking request and replace it with our own. This means the native club must have at least one available slot on the selected date.  See the documentation for XHR Response Interception (Fake Slot Injection) on how we ensure that there is always an available slot on the selected date, even if we have to synthesize falsely that slot.
Cross-browser note: Chrome pre-renders the bottom bar container (`.white-bg.p-2 .container`) in a disabled state before any slot is clicked, so it is always present when `selectCourtOption` runs. Firefox renders it asynchronously, only after Angular processes the `nativeSlot.click()`. Therefore `nativeSlot.click()` must be called unconditionally before any bottom bar querySelector check; a one-shot `MutationObserver` (`tryUpdateBottomBar`) then fires once Angular renders the bar.
 
### DOM Injection
We hide (not remove) native content and inject our own `<div class="all-clubs-availability">` into two containers Angular uses for desktop (`.item-tile`) and mobile (`.d-md-none.px-3`). We re-inject whenever the MutationObserver detects container changes (e.g. date change).
When resolving injection hosts, prefer containers that actually contain native time-slot rows (`app-court-time-slot-item`) rather than matching broad layout selectors globally. This avoids mis-targeting unrelated `.item-tile` nodes in some mobile/browser variants (for example, Firefox Android layout behavior).
When unhiding native UI, only unhide elements the helper explicitly hid (using a `data-*` marker), rather than globally unhiding all children under broad host selectors.

To reduce churn from Angular mutation bursts, booking-flow DOM reconciliation is batched through `requestAnimationFrame`, so repeated mutation callbacks collapse into one reconcile pass per frame.
Booking-step selectors and related visibility checks are centralized in `getBookingDomQueryService()` so monitor, injection, and cleanup logic share one source of truth for brittle Angular DOM signatures.

### Scheduled Bookings

Bay Club opens booking windows exactly 3 days in advance at the minute of the slot. The helper makes locked slots (beyond the window) clickable and books them automatically when the window opens.

**Locked slot → partner picker flow**: Clicking a locked slot calls `handleLockedSlotClick`, which fetches the player list (see below), then renders an inline partner picker entirely within the helper UI. No Angular state machine interaction occurs. The user selects partners and clicks Schedule; `getScheduledBookingService().scheduleBooking()` persists the record and sets timers.

**Player list strategy (cache-first)**:
1. Check `bc_possible_players` and `bc_player_photos` in localStorage. If present, use immediately.
2. If absent, XHR interception of the native `possiblePlayers` and `photos/members` endpoints populates the cache automatically during any normal booking flow.
3. If still absent, `fetchPossiblePlayers` fetches `GET /profile/api/1.0/profile/household` and `GET /buddy-list/api/1.0/buddylist` in parallel. It merges household `addOns` (status `Active`) and buddy list items (status `Approved`), deduped by `personId`. Photos are fetched for all players plus the primary user in the same call, then both player list and photos are cached. No `courtBookingId` is needed.
- Player objects from household use `memberIdentifier` for photo lookup; buddy list objects use `memberId` for the same concept. Both are normalized to `memberIdentifier` in the merged result. Photo lookups and `data-member-id` card attributes use `player.memberIdentifier || player.memberId` to handle both XHR-cached (old format) and API-fetched (new format) players.
- The photos API (`checkin/api/1.0/photos/members`) requires **repeated** query params (`?membersIds=X&membersIds=Y`), not comma-separated. Only use a photo when `state !== 'NotAllowed'`.
- `cachePhotosFromXhr` always **merges** into the existing cache — never replaces — so a sparse on-demand result cannot evict richer XHR-intercepted data.

**Two-step booking API**:
1. `POST courtbookings` with `{ clubId, courtId, date, timeFromInMinutes, timeToInMinutes, categoryOptionsId, timeSlotId }` → response `{ courtBookingId }`.
2. `PUT courtbookings/{courtBookingId}/confirm` with `{ invitations: [{ personId }], isVisibleToBuddies: true }`.
Partners are mandatory. The `Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key` header is static.

**Fire sequence**: Handled entirely server-side by the Cloudflare Worker cron (see below). The browser tab does not need to stay open. On success or failure, the Worker sends an email notification via Resend from `notifications@bayclubhelper.app`.

**`/bookings` pending section**: `injectPendingBookingsSection` injects a "Pending Bookings" section showing active (pending/firing) and failed bookings. Countdowns are updated by a dedicated 60-second `setInterval` that also polls the Worker for status changes. Never update DOM text inside `injectPendingBookingsSection` when the section already exists — doing so re-triggers the `MutationObserver → scheduleReconcile → RAF` cycle at up to 60 fps, making the page unresponsive. Structural moves (e.g. `insertBefore` to relocate the section above `app-calendar-cancelled-by-me-list` when the cancelled list renders after initial injection) are safe because they are one-shot and stabilize immediately. `fetchAllFromWorker` dispatches a `CustomEvent('bc-bookings-updated')` after updating `cachedBookings`; `createBookingsCalendarExportInstaller` listens for it to call `scheduleReconcile`. This is more reliable than the MutationObserver DOM-nudge pattern in Firefox, where an append+remove that resolves before the next microtask checkpoint may not trigger the observer.

**`getScheduledBookingService()`** is the singleton closure service owning all of: Worker API calls, local booking cache, player/photo caching, notification email/phone fetching, refresh token sync, and the public API (`scheduleBooking`, `cancelBooking`, `dismissBooking`, `getActiveBookings`, `getFailedBookings`, `fetchPossiblePlayers`, `fetchNotificationEmail`, `pushRefreshToken`, `syncRefreshTokenFromAppStorage`, `initializeOnPageLoad`, and XHR cache helpers).

**Refresh token management**: On every page load, `syncRefreshTokenFromAppStorage()` reads the Angular app's auth state from `localStorage.connect20auth` (where the app persists its token after login) and PUTs the refresh token to the Worker's `PUT /token` endpoint. The XHR and fetch interceptors also forward any token responses seen during the session. This keeps the Worker's KV refresh token perpetually current without manual bootstrapping.

### Navigation Cleanup
The script uses a booking-flow monitor with lifecycle management:
- It patches `history.pushState` and `history.replaceState` (and listens to `popstate`) to detect flow transitions when Angular emits them.
- Those history wrappers are intentionally left installed for the page lifetime. They are lightweight and improve reliability because uninstalling and reinstalling wrappers around flow transitions can miss Angular navigation events.
- While on the booking flow, it runs active monitoring (MutationObservers plus a fast URL poll) to catch transitions that Angular performs without reliable history events.
- Outside the booking flow, it tears down active monitoring and switches to a lightweight bootstrap poll that only checks for re-entry.
- On `visibilitychange`, it pauses monitoring while the tab is hidden and performs immediate state reconciliation when the tab becomes visible again.
- Back-to-home cleanup is triggered through one delegated capture-phase click listener on `document`, scoped to `app-page-title`, covering both the back arrow icon and `BACK TO HOME` text controls.
- On exit from booking flow, it cleans up injected content, clears booking state, and aborts in-flight availability fetches.
- As an additional safeguard, if the page title is `COURT BOOKING` and Hour View controls are absent, injected slot UI is cleared. This guard is intentionally constrained so it does not trigger on the duration/player filter screen where auto-selection and club-order injection still need to run.

## UI Features

- **Multi-club availability**: All four clubs shown grouped by Morning / Afternoon / Evening
- **Grouped time slots**: Multiple courts at the same time shown as a single expandable card; single-court slots are directly selectable
- **Edge court indicators**: **E** marks courts on the edges of the court area (less ball spillage); **G** marks gated courts (e.g. surrounded by a fence), which are the most prized; **H** marks courts adjacent to a hitting wall, displayed alongside E or G
- **Club preference ordering**: Drag-and-drop widget on the duration selector page, persisted to localStorage
  Drag lifecycle wiring for this widget is encapsulated in `getClubOrderWidgetController()`, keeping transient drag state private.
- **Time range filter**: Dual-handle slider to filter slots by time of day, persisted to localStorage
  Slider drag lifecycle and transient drag state are encapsulated in `getTimeRangeSliderController()`.
- **Indoor courts toggle**: Hides outdoor-only clubs; persisted to localStorage
- **Hourly weather**: Fetches hourly forecast from Open-Meteo API; shows the relevant emoji below each hour label on the time range slider; rain emojis are accompanied by a centred rain-probability percentage
  Weather data and cache are encapsulated in an in-file `getWeatherService()` closure with a narrow API (`whenReady`, `emojiForHour`, `rainPctForHour`).
- **Hour View auto-select**: Automatically clicks "HOUR VIEW" button on first render (marked with `data-bc-auto-selected` to avoid re-firing)
- **By-club / By-time toggle**: Two-button toggle switches between grouping slots by club (default) or by time slot; persisted to localStorage
- **Duration and player preference auto-select**: Native selection controls are re-applied from localStorage through a dedicated `getPreferenceAutoSelectService()` closure so temporary fallback-suppression state stays internal.
- **Scheduled bookings**: Locked slots (beyond the 3-day booking window) are clickable. Clicking one opens an inline partner picker built entirely by the helper — no Angular state machine involvement. After the user selects partners and taps Schedule, the helper persists the booking to localStorage and fires the two-step booking API (`POST courtbookings` → `PUT courtbookings/{id}/confirm`) at the exact moment the window opens. A "Pending Bookings" section on `/bookings` shows countdown, scheduled time, and a Cancel button for each pending booking. Failed attempts show with a red error row and a Dismiss button.
- **Debug mode panel**: When debug mode is enabled, the injected availability UI includes a compact panel with a toggle plus `Copy logs`, `Email logs`, `Download logs`, and `Clear logs` controls for support troubleshooting.

## Debug Mode Activation And Logging

- Debug mode is intentionally hidden behind a user-friendly activation handshake that works on any Bay Club page.
- Activation methods:
  Five taps/clicks in the top-left corner (72 by 72 pixels) within 4 seconds.
  Typing `debug` within 5 seconds while focus is not in an input, textarea, or contenteditable field.
- Activation should set `bc_debug_enabled` to `'1'` and show a confirmation alert.
- Debug entries are capped in a ring buffer (`MAX_DEBUG_ENTRIES`) and persisted so logs survive page refreshes.
- Debug payloads must be sanitized before persistence or console output. Sensitive keys such as authorization, session, token, and request identifiers should be redacted.
- The `Email logs` action should attempt to open a `mailto:` draft in a new tab first, with a same-tab fallback if pop-up policies block opening a new tab.
- Debug panel action buttons should follow the same visual style as the helper controls and should not appear sticky after click.

## Code Conventions

- **Prefer `data-*` attributes over structural CSS selectors** for targeting injected elements
- **Encode state in the DOM where possible** rather than global variables (e.g. `data-bc-auto-selected`, `data-selected`, `data-bc-intercepted`)
- **For native hide/unhide lifecycles, use explicit marker attributes** (for example, `data-bc-native-hidden`) so cleanup only reverses helper-owned DOM mutations.
- **Prefer event-driven detection first, then add polling only as a reliability backstop** — this SPA sometimes does not emit dependable history signals, so scoped pollers are acceptable when lifecycle-managed
- **Minimize global state** — use closures (IIFEs) to scope implementation details (e.g. `lastBookingRequestId` is scoped inside the `send` IIFE)
  For example, drag-and-drop item reordering state is scoped inside `getClubOrderWidgetController()` rather than script scope.
  Time-range slider drag state is similarly scoped inside `getTimeRangeSliderController()`.
- **Prefer service-shaped modules for non-trivial logic** — when logic has internal state or lifecycle, place it behind an in-file service/controller creator rather than free-floating functions and variables.
- **Service creators own singleton behavior** — if a service should be singleton for the page lifecycle, implement singleton ownership inside the service creator itself.
- **Use creator-owned access consistently** — call singleton-backed creators directly at usage sites (for example: `getWeatherService().whenReady()`), rather than storing script-scope service alias variables.
- **Avoid two-phase initialization for services** — when feasible, let creators self-initialize and keep lifecycle guards inside the creator so startup is one-step and idempotent.
- **Use guarded installer creators for one-time setup** — for setup work like style injection or monitor wiring, prefer creator-owned one-time guards instead of free-floating initialization flags.
- **Lower constants to feature-local scope when practical** — keep constants near their usage to reduce script-wide surface area, while preserving shared enum constants where cross-feature reuse is intentional.
- **CSS for visual state** — selection appearance is driven by `[data-selected]` CSS rules, not inline style mutations
- **No external dependencies** — single self-contained userscript file
- **Centralized local storage access** — preference persistence reads and writes flow through a singleton `getLocalStorageService()` creator so parsing, serialization, and parse-failure logging behavior are consistent.
- **Prefer explicit enum-like values over nullable/optional parameters for behavioral variation** — when a parameter controls which behavior a function performs, always pass an explicit string constant (e.g. `LABEL_MODE_TIME`, `LABEL_MODE_CLUB`) rather than a nullable or omitted argument (e.g. `labelOverride = null`). Nullable optionals hide intent at call sites and are easy to accidentally omit. Explicit constants make every call self-documenting.
- **Define enum values as SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE constants** — string literals used as enum-like values should be named constants (e.g. `const VIEW_MODE_BY_TIME = 'by-time'`), not bare string literals scattered across the codebase. This ensures typos are caught by linting and refactoring is safe.
- **Prefer semantic, domain-specific names** — choose function and variable names that describe business intent and lifecycle context (for example: `resumeBookingFlowMonitoringAfterVisible`) rather than generic verbs (for example: `resumeMonitoring`).
- **Decompose multi-step functions into named helpers** — rather than using inline comments like `// Step 1: ...`, extract each step into a function whose name describes *what* it does (e.g. `filterSlotsByTimeRange`, `collapseEmptyTimeGroups`). The sequence of calls in the top-level function then reads as self-documenting prose without needing comments.
- **Group render orchestration in a pipeline service** — availability rendering and related filter application flow through `getAvailabilityRenderPipeline()` so UI assembly and post-render behavior stay coordinated in one module.
- **Use monitor-scoped lifecycle helpers for watcher wiring** — booking-flow observer and poller resources are managed through monitor-local keyed helper functions so start/stop paths are centralized and teardown behavior stays consistent.

## Global State (intentional)

Most mutable booking/network state is encapsulated in a singleton in-file service (`getBookingStateService()`), rather than free-floating script-level variables.
Duration/player preference auto-selection also uses an in-file closure service (`getPreferenceAutoSelectService()`) so transient selection-suppression state is not exposed at script scope.

- `lastFetchState` — `{ transformed, params, failedClubIds }` — the last fetched and transformed availability data plus request params and per-club failure markers
- `pendingSlotBooking` — `{ clubId, courtId, date, fromMinutes, toMinutes }` — set when user selects a slot, consumed by the XHR interceptor
- `currentAbortController` — lets us cancel in-flight fetches when user navigates away
- `capturedHeaders` — auth headers captured from native XHR requests

## localStorage Keys

- `bc_club_order` — JSON array of club UUIDs in user's preferred display order *(synced to Worker KV)*
- `bc_time_range` — `{ startMinutes, endMinutes }` — time range filter state *(synced to Worker KV)*
- `bc_indoor_only` — boolean — indoor courts filter state *(synced to Worker KV)*
- `bc_view_mode` — `'by-club'` | `'by-time'` — availability panel layout mode *(synced to Worker KV)*
- `bc_debug_enabled` — `'1'` | `'0'` — debug mode enabled state
- `bc_debug_entries` — JSON array of debug log entries for copy/download support workflows
- `bc_possible_players` — player list cached from the `possiblePlayers` API, populated by XHR interception during normal booking flows and used by the partner picker for locked slots
- `bc_player_photos` — photo map `{ memberId: { photoId, state } }`, always merged (never replaced) on update to preserve richer XHR-intercepted data over sparser on-demand fetch results
- `bc_notification_email` — user's email address cached from `profile/api/1.0/profile`, embedded in booking records for Worker email notifications
- `bc_self_profile` — `{ firstName, lastName }` of the logged-in user, cached from `connect20auth` or `profile/api/1.0/profile`; used to show the logged-in user as a pre-selected non-interactive card at the top of the partner picker

Note: scheduled booking records are stored in Cloudflare Worker KV (`scheduled_bookings` key), not in localStorage. The extension maintains a local `cachedBookings` array populated by `GET /bookings` from the Worker. The six synced preferences (`bc_club_order`, `bc_view_mode`, `bc_indoor_only`, `bc_time_range`, `bc_players`, `bc_duration`) are also mirrored to Worker KV under `prefs:{email}` via `getPreferenceSyncService()`, which pulls on page load (server wins) and pushes on change with an 800 ms debounce.

## Cloudflare Worker (`cloudflare-worker/`)

Server-side component that executes scheduled bookings without requiring the browser tab to stay open.

- **Worker URL**: `https://bayclubconnect-bookings.mark-rubin.workers.dev`
- **Secrets** (set via `wrangler secret put`): `WORKER_SECRET`, `RESEND_API_KEY`
- **KV namespace**: `BC_BOOKINGS` (id `299d14645bed49458addc9751cc6c241`); keys: `refresh_token:{email}` (per user), `scheduled_bookings`, `last_token_refresh`, `prefs:{email}` (per user)
- **D1 database**: `bayclubconnect-history` (id `e1f2166f-1c61-47f4-8675-bfa4a003d29a`); bound as `DB`; table `booking_history` — permanent record of every completed, failed, or cancelled booking. Rows written via `appendToHistory()` after every cron outcome and every cancel/dismiss. Uses `INSERT OR IGNORE` to prevent duplicates.
- **Cron**: every minute — finds `status === 'pending'` bookings whose `fireAtMs` has passed, marks `firing`, calls Bay Club two-step booking API, saves result, sends email
- **Auth**: Bay Club refresh token stored in KV per-user under `refresh_token:{notificationEmail}`; rotated immediately after every use (single-use tokens). `client_id=connect20`, `client_secret=connectSecret` for both password and refresh grants. Per-user storage prevents multiple extension users from overwriting each other's tokens.
- **Email**: Resend API, sender `notifications@bayclubhelper.app`. `RESEND_API_KEY` secret. Recipient is `notificationEmail` embedded in the booking record (fetched from `profile/api/1.0/profile` at scheduling time and cached to `bc_notification_email` in localStorage).
- **CORS**: allows `https://bayclubconnect.com` for `GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS`.
- **HTTP endpoints**:
  - `GET /status` — public health check (aggregate only); includes full `scheduledBookings` only when secret-authenticated
  - `GET /bookings` — list all bookings (secret required)
  - `POST /bookings` — add a booking (secret required)
  - `DELETE /bookings/{id}` — remove a booking (secret required)
  - `PUT /token` — store a fresh refresh token in KV under `refresh_token:{userId}` (secret required); called automatically by the extension on page load
  - `GET /prefs` — get synced preferences for a user (secret + `X-User-Id` header required); called by `getPreferenceSyncService()` on page load
  - `PUT /prefs` — save synced preferences for a user (secret required); body `{ userId, prefs }`; called with 800 ms debounce after any preference change
  - `GET /history` — last 100 rows from D1 `booking_history` as JSON (secret required; header or `?secret=`)
  - `GET /dashboard` — self-refreshing HTML monitoring page with active bookings + history (secret required; header or `?secret=`)
- **Token bootstrap**: if a user's KV token is ever lost, reload bayclubconnect.com — `syncRefreshTokenFromAppStorage()` pushes it automatically. For manual recovery: `wrangler kv key put --namespace-id 299d14645bed49458addc9751cc6c241 "refresh_token:email@example.com" "<token>" --remote`.
- **Deploy**: `cd cloudflare-worker && wrangler deploy`

## External Assumptions And Contracts

These are the main Bay Club behaviors and DOM patterns the helper depends on. When something breaks after a Bay Club change, this list is a good first place to check.

- **Availability API endpoint and shape**:
  - The native Hour View uses `https://connect-api.bayclubs.io/court-booking/api/1.0/availability?...`.
  - The JSON response has a `clubsAvailabilities` array; the first element is the home club whose availability the native Hour View is rendering.
  - Each entry contains `courts` and `availableTimeSlots` collections shaped as of March 2026.
- **Booking API endpoint**:
  - The native booking flow posts to a URL whose path ends with `courtbookings`.
  - The helper rewrites only these POSTs, based on `pendingSlotBooking` and the last availability params.
- **Native Hour View slot DOM**:
  - Hour View renders native slots as `app-court-time-slot-item div.time-slot`.
  - The helper clicks one of these slots on selection so Angular’s booking state machine advances correctly.
  - If these elements disappear or are renamed, the helper’s injected UI should fall back to the native Hour View via the on-error banner.
- **Booking-flow URLs and shell**:
  - The court booking flow currently uses URLs containing `create-booking`.
  - The shared booking shell (including `app-page-title` and Hour View controls) continues to exist even if Bay Club tweaks intermediate steps.
- **Bookings pages for calendar export and scheduled bookings**:
  - The bookings list is at `/bookings`. Individual upcoming events are `app-racquet-sports-booking-calendar-event` inside `app-paged-list`. Note: `app-calendar-events-list` does **not** exist in the live DOM (as of March 2026).
  - Cancelled bookings live inside `app-calendar-cancelled-by-me-list`, which is inside `app-calendar`.
  - `app-calendar` and `app-paged-list` have **different parent `DIV`s** — do not assume a shared ancestor when finding insertion points.
  - Booking detail pages live at `/racquet-sports/booking/:id` and expose a header container matching `.image-background .px-4.pb-4`.
  - The “Reservation made by” row matches `.row.mt-2.size-14` with text containing “reservation made by”.
- **Date and time text formats on bookings screens**:
  - Day labels are one of:
    - `Today` / `Tomorrow`.
    - Month–day strings like `Feb 27`.
    - A browser-parsable date string handled by `new Date(...)`.
  - Time ranges are formatted as `H:MM - H:MM AM/PM` (for example: `7:00 - 8:30 PM`) when start and end are in the same period, or as `H:MM AM - H:MM PM` when the slot crosses noon (for example: `11:30 AM - 1:00 PM`).
  - When these assumptions fail, the helper logs `bookings-parse-day-label-failed` or `bookings-parse-time-range-failed` in debug mode to make format changes easier to diagnose.

## Linting

ESLint with flat config (`eslint.config.mjs`). Intentionally unused args, vars, and caught errors can be prefixed with `_` and are ignored by lint. When you lint, check for function calls that don't agree with the arity of the functions being called.

## Userscript Tests

The userscript has a Vitest suite (`loading_script.test.mjs`) covering pure utility functions that have historically had bugs. Run it after any change to `loading_script.user.js`:

```bash
npm run test:script
```

Functions covered: `pacificSlotTimeMs`, `timePartsTo24Hour`, `inferStartHour24`, `parseTimeRange`, `normalizeWhitespace`, `buildGoogleCalendarUrl`, `buildIcsContent`, `getIcsDownloadFileName`, `formatCountdown`, and their helpers. The script is loaded under jsdom via a `module.exports` escape hatch at the end of the IIFE (`_bcTestExports` accumulator). External fetch calls are stubbed in `vitest.setup.mjs`.

## Worker Tests

The Cloudflare Worker has a Vitest suite. Run it after any change to `cloudflare-worker/worker.js` and before running `wrangler deploy`:

```bash
cd cloudflare-worker && npm test
```

Tests cover all HTTP endpoints, pure helper functions, and the cron tick logic (KV and D1 are in-memory mocks; external fetch calls are stubbed). See `cloudflare-worker/CLOUDFLARE.md` → Testing for details.

## Canary Tests

Playwright end-to-end tests that run against the live bayclubconnect.com site with the userscript injected. They serve as both a regression guard for our own code and a canary for Bay Club DOM/API changes. Requires `.env` with `BC_EMAIL` and `BC_PASSWORD` (copied from `canary-tests/.env.example`).

```bash
cd canary-tests && npm test          # headless
cd canary-tests && npm test -- --headed   # watch the browser
```

The suite covers: Open-Meteo weather API shape, Bay Club availability API contract, booking POST URL, native booking DOM selectors, `/bookings` page DOM, our injected availability UI, by-club/by-time toggle, indoor-only toggle, time range slider, locked slot → partner picker flow, and booking flow cleanup.

**Key calibration notes**:
- Club sections are identified by `data-club-id` UUID attributes, not by text — the API `shortName` for some clubs may differ from our display label.
- Locked-slot tests reset `bc_time_range` and `bc_indoor_only` in localStorage before clicking a slot, then bounce the date selection to force a re-render, because the Worker preference sync may have restored narrow filter values on page load.
- The `app-calendar-cancelled-by-me-list` test skips gracefully when the user has no cancelled bookings (the element is conditionally rendered by Angular).
- `test.setTimeout(120_000)` must be called at the top of `beforeAll` for the locked-slot describe block — `test.describe.configure({ timeout })` does not extend `beforeAll` hook timeouts in Playwright 1.58.

## Running All Tests

```bash
npm test                             # runs test:script then test:worker (unit + worker)
cd canary-tests && npm test          # end-to-end canary suite (requires live credentials)
```
