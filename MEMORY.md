## User Preferences

- After making code changes, always run `git d` so the user's diff editor launches.

## In-Progress Feature Design

- **Scheduled/pending bookings**: full design captured in `scheduled-bookings-feature.md`.
  Not yet implemented. Key blocker: need to determine whether partners are in the initial
  `courtbookings` POST or a separate follow-up call (Mark will do a test booking to find out).
